# Ranking-System-Using-Linear-Regression-

The goal of this project is to use machine learning solutions to rank entities with a linear regression model using Gaussian radial basis functions.  The closed form solution is used to train the linear regression model. Also, the same model is trained using stochastic gradient descent method to do a comparative study.
